# Here, We define what the user is going to do 
#    1. To get data from the database using Query
#    2. To push data into the database -> mutation

# Query -> to give data to the user
# String -> response type. ! means It's not nullable

type Person{
    id: Int!
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    gender: String!
}
type Query{
    people: [Person]!
    person(id: Int!): Person #we might not find the person with the id so no '!' next to Person
}
